# EDA-on-Titanic-Dataset
In this step, we performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the cleaned Titanic dataset to understand patterns, trends, and key insights. This involved looking at the structure of the data, identifying relationships between features (like age, gender, and survival), and visualizing distributions using graphs and charts.

 What We Did:
 
Loaded the cleaned Titanic dataset

Checked basic info and statistics using .info() and .describe()

Analyzed survival counts and survival rates by gender, class, etc.

Plotted histograms, bar charts, and other visuals using Seaborn and Matplotlib

Observed which features (like age, fare, gender) might influence survival
